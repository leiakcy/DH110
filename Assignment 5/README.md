# Assigment 05: Low-Fidelity Prototype
## Leia Ku Cheng Yee, DH110

### Project Description 
**Purpose**: The purpose of my low-fidelity prototypes is to check and test the functionality and flow of the new features.  It allows me to translate my high-level design concepts into physical and tangible entities that other people can interact with in order to identify flaws in functionality. In this project, I have just added the feature for users to upload documents, share and filter articles. 

**Persona and Features**: The user personas that I have identified are senior citizens that want to share their knowledge, love to read and have the desire to keep their minds active. The first persona is Larry Johnson, who is a retired teacher that wants to spread his knowledge, and also find a community that is eager to learn. I propose a feature that allow users to easily upload and publish their documents, and also enable them to save documents to draft, edit and delete them whenever they want. Moreover, the second persona is Park Soo Young, who is a retired writer who wants to easily look up articles written by the authors she like. The feature that I proposed is the filter button that enable her to quickly sort out articles by genres, authors and date published. I also propose the share button, that can allow users to share articles across different communication channels.

**Tasks**:
1. Upload documents/media
2. Public documents/media
3. Save documents/media as draft 
4. Filter articles
5. Share articles
