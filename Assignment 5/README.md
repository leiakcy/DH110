# Assigment 05: Low-Fidelity Prototype
## Leia Ku Cheng Yee, DH110

### Project Description 
**Purpose**: The purpose of my low-fidelity prototypes is to check and test the functionality and flow of the new features.  It allows me to translate my high-level design concepts into physical and tangible entities that other people can interact with in order to identify flaws in functionality. In this project, I have just added the feature for users to upload documents, share and filter articles. 

**Persona and Features**: The user personas that I have identified are senior citizens that want to share their knowledge, love to read and have the desire to keep their minds active. The first persona is Larry Johnson, who is a retired teacher that wants to spread his knowledge, and also find a community that is eager to learn. I propose a feature that allow users to easily upload and publish their documents, and also enable them to save documents to draft, edit and delete them whenever they want. Moreover, the second persona is Park Soo Young, who is a retired writer who wants to easily look up articles written by the authors she like. The feature that I proposed is the filter button that enable her to quickly sort out articles by genres, authors and date published. I also propose the share button, that can allow users to share articles across different communication channels.

**Tasks**:
1. Upload documents/media
2. Public documents/media
3. Save documents/media as draft 
4. Filter articles
5. Share articles

**Flow Description**:The flow is intend to facilitate the users' process of uploading files to share with others, including additional features like edit, delete and save as drafts. Once 

**Feature Description**: Once users click on the *upload* button, they will navigate to a page that enables them to easily drag and drop their files to upload to the website. After the file is uploaded, users are given the option to *publish* the file immediately or *save to draft*. If the users choose to save their file to draft, they will be brought to the "Drafts" page, where they have to option to *edit, delete,* and *publish* their files from their drafts. Users also have the flexibility to make any changes necessary to their files once they're published. Moreover, to facilitate the articles sorting process, the *filter* feature is introduced to allow users to sort and filter articles based on the author, genre, and date. If the user is satisfied with the article and wants to share with their peers, there is also a *share* feature that allow users to share the article across multiple communication channels.
