# Assignment 02: Usability Testing
## Leia Ku Cheng Yee, DH110


### Introduction

The UC SHIP website is a platform that provides information and documents about the Student Health Insurance Plan, including the benefits, medical coverage, how to waive the insurance plan, how to claim for prescription etc. The website also provides contact information for specific UC campuses, so students can get in touch with their own Student Health Center. This website is accessible to the public, and its main purpose is to help students gain insight on their insurance plan. 

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on the website, a few usability concerns surfaced. First of all, the design of the website lack error prevention. This is because of the confusing navigation and menu layout, and there is also no search button for users to look up specific information. Besides, the overall design and terminology of the website makes it difficult for users to recall the workings of the system. It may be difficult for users to retreive information from the overly length and complex homepage. Moreover, the aesthetic design of the website is clustured and unpleasant. At first glance, the pages look extremely wordy, and contains several repeated information that can be removed to make the website more minimalistic.

In order to target these problems, we will be performing a usability test for the UC SHIP website. The purpose of a usability test is to gain a better understanding  of the site's interface, and to identify design flaws that hinder users' ability to complete tasks. Additionally, a usability test can also help to improve a site from a user's perspective. The usabilty test sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement for the website. During the tests, the users will be given a few tasks to examine the efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction of the website. The user will also be required to think aloud when doing the tasks.

### Methodology 

The pilot usability test will be conducted in my apartment. To record the usability test session, I will utilize Zoom and ensure that the screen, moderator, participant, and audio is recorded. Both the participant and moderator will be using their individual laptops to do the usability test. This usability test is a pilot test, with my roommate being the user.

**The process of the usability test was as follows:**

- Intro
- Informed consent 
- Pre-test questions
- Tasks
- Post-test questions
- Product satisfaction card
- Demographics

**The following results were measured (many using the seven-point Likert scale):**

- Ease of use
- Frequency of use
- Learn ability
- Trustworthiness
- Site organization
- Site content
- How the user felt after using site

### Reflection

The pilot usability test taught me several things both about the usability of the UC SHIP website and the UT process itself.

During the usability test, I have gained more insights about the usability concerns existed in the UC SHIP website. First of all, users find it hard to navigate back to the homepage after clicking on items in the menu bar because of how small the text "Home" is. This enhanced the lack of error prevention on the website. Due to the overcrowding of information on the pages, the participant also struggled to find information about how to submit an application to waive UC SHIP. Moreover, in the post-test questionnaire, although she described the website as familiar and trustworthy, she also think the website is old and boring. Overall, the particpant's feedback was neutral to negative, and has demonstrated potential areas for improvement on the website. 

As a moderator in the usability test, I learned to keep a neutral tone, and control my facial expression to avoid distracting the participant. I have also learned to be patient because at times, it took longer than expected for the participant to finish a task. While she was doing the task, I paid detailed attention to what she was struggling with, and try to identify things to be improved while she was completing the tasks. Overall, the pilot UT went good. However, I wished I have reminded the participant to think aloud more often when browsing through the website. I have also identified a few typos in my questionnaire while reading them out loud to the participant. Given these errors, I can improve the usability test by carefully read through the survey first, and make sure the script is more prepared.
