# Assigment 03: Contextual Inquiry 
## Leia Ku Cheng Yee, DH110

### Description of the Project 

#### Design Challenge 
The main purpose of this project is to provide resources, entertaintment and guide seniors in their day-to-day activities. This project can also help users to find their communities, and self-develop during their leisure time. There are various sites that already exist that provide resources to seniors like Suddenly Senior, Senior Guide to Computers, Senior Net etc. Although there are many of these websites that already exist, there are few that consolidate these resources in an easily understandable, and engaging way. The limitations that could be improved with technology are that it is hard to refine and filter information, and the disorganization of information can hinder usability. There is also lack indication of what page the users are on, making it difficult for users to recall the workings of the system.

#### Target Users
I want to create a website that is straightforward, easily navigable, and have sufficient resources that is organized in hierarchical manner. The target users of this project are predominantly senior citizens (age 50 and above) with limited technological skills, lower-income and less-educated, but anyone who are looking for guides to their day-to-day activities can also use the website. Users would have access to the website anywhere they want, as long as there is internet connection. These users typically use the website to look for recommendations and guides of items that they are less familiar with. And in order to complete a search, the users usually seek help from the internet or trust word-of-mouth.

#### Research Methods
To better understand how different users will interact with the website, I have conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, the session is conducted remotely on Zoom.

### Reflection
I think the contextual inquiry has allowed to me to gain insights and uncover usability problems that I didn't notice from conducting the heauristic evaluation. The user, Amanda was able to complete the tasks provided, but she did find it difficult to navigate through the different pages on the website due to the disorganization of the site and the complex navigation bars on the right. She also mentioned that the design was very boring and unapealling, bombarded with too many ads, and the typography of the website is not engaging at all. Since there is lack hierarchy in content organization, it is hard for her to stay focus when reading through the information. On the other hand, she really enjoyed the hyperlinks to different resources, and she finds that the different articles do provide useful information. Amanda also thinks having a bookmark tool is a good method to use for the website so users can easily refer back to information that they have already seen, and it also saves a lot of time. Overall, she rated the website a 5 out of 10. 

Throughout the contextual inquiry, I have also learned a few things about the process. It is really insightful to see how the user interact with the product, and it provided me a lot of useful data for improvements. When performing the interview, I learned that is important to eliminate all biases and try to view the product from an outsider perspective. Moreover, I also find that I need to keep my script for contextual inquiry rather loose and flexible, because the user was very immersed in the process, and have her own way of interacting with the website. Overall, the interview went very smoothly because the technology and equipment set up was convenient and easy since it's on Zoom, so moving from section to section was natural, and the interviewee did a great job of speaking out loud. The conversation is also very informal and casual, so she wasn't hesitant to criticize the website. However, I think I can spend a little more time to interview her to gain more insight about the website. The experience was very fun, and it opened my eyes to other usability problems of the website, and also help me better undersand my interviewee and my target users.
