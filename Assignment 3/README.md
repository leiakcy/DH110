# Assigment 03: Contextual Inquiry 
## Leia Ku Cheng Yee, DH110

### Description of the Project 

#### Design Challenge 
The main purpose of this project is to provide resources, entertaintment and guide seniors in their day-to-day activities. This project can also help users to find their communities, and self-develop during their leisure time. There are various sites that already exist that provide resources to seniors like Suddenly Senior, Senior Guide to Computers, Senior Net etc. Although there are many of these websites that already exist, there are few that consolidate these resources in an easily understandable, and engaging way. The limitations that could be improved with technology are that it is hard to refine and filter information, and the disorganization of information can hinder usability. There is also lack indication of what page the users are on, making it difficult for users to recall the workings of the system.

#### Target Users
I want to create a website that is straightforward, easily navigable, and have sufficient resources that is organized in hierarchical manner. The target users of this project are predominantly senior citizens (age 50 and above) with limited technological skills, lower-income and less-educated, but anyone who are looking for guides to their day-to-day activities can also use the website. Users would have access to the website anywhere they want, as long as there is internet connection. These users typically use the website to look for recommendations and guides of items that they are less familiar with. And in order to complete a search, the users usually seek help from the internet or trust word-of-mouth.

#### Research Methods
To better understand how different users will interact with the website, I have conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, the session is conducted remotely on Zoom.
