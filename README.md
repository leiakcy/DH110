# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation

### Make Exploring UC SHIP Coverage Accessible

As a student who has UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) coverage, I have explored the UC SHIP website numerous times before all my visitations to a clinic, a dentist, or a hospital. Especially during these times of crises, I want to ensure that the health plan covers my prescriptions and visitation outside of the UCLA Student Health Center. However, I find the website hard to navigate, because I am bombarded with so much information at the home page. By improving the UX design, the website will  be more accesible, user-friendly, and less overwhelming. 

### UC SHIP Website

*UC SHIP's website is built for students enrolled in University of California's campuses, and it is where students get a better understanding about their health covereage, the benefits, claims, where to get a referral etc.  UC SHIP provides high-quality, affordable and convenient coverage that protects students from unexpected health care costs. UC SHIP in conjunction with the campus Student Health Center also works diligently with affiliated vendors (Anthem, Delta Dental, Academic Health Plans) to ensure that their systems are upgraded as soon as possible.

| Heuristics | Note |
| ---------- | ---- |
| Visibility of the system | It is good to have the user's radio system (KVCR): But it is not clear where the news was published or simply it is missing date/time information which users may want to check by default|
