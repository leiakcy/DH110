# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
## DH110, Leia Ku Cheng Yee

### Make Exploring UC SHIP Coverage Accessible

As a student who has UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) coverage, I have explored the UC SHIP website numerous times before all my visitations to a clinic, a dentist, or a hospital. Especially during these times of crises, I want to ensure that the health plan covers my prescriptions and visitation outside of the UCLA Student Health Center. However, I find the website hard to navigate, because I am bombarded with so much information at the home page. By improving the UX design, the website will  be more accesible, user-friendly, and less overwhelming. 

### UC SHIP Website

https://www.ucop.edu/ucship/index.html

*UC SHIP's website is built for students enrolled in University of California's campuses, and it is where students get a better understanding about their health covereage, the benefits, claims, where to get a referral etc.  UC SHIP provides high-quality, affordable and convenient coverage that protects students from unexpected health care costs. UC SHIP in conjunction with the campus Student Health Center also works diligently with affiliated vendors (Anthem, Delta Dental, Academic Health Plans) to ensure that their systems are upgraded as soon as possible.*

### Initial Evaluation 
The search tools and information infrastructure of the page is rather confusing and can hinder user's efficiency. On the home page, there is a menu bar on the top of the page and a naviagtion bar on the left, and both bars present very different information. However, once you click on a menu item, you can no longer see the navigation bar, which hinders user control. There is also lack of organizations and hierarchy of content on the website, which needs to be fixed to ease usability.


| Heuristics | Rating | Evaluation |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | 
| #1 Visuality of System Status | 2 | When a user lands on the home page, they are immediately informed through the banner of what the system is about. However, with the small font size, and the large amount of information bombarded to users, it is unclear of what the key components are. Besides there is no search button, so users can't directly look up the desired information.
