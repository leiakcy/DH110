# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation

### Make Exploring UC Ship Coverage Accessible

As a student who has UC Ship Health Insurance Coverage, I have explored the UC Ship website numerous times before all my visitations to a clinic, a dentist, or a hospital. Especially during these times of crises, I want to ensure that the health plan covers my prescriptions and visitation outside of the UCLA Student Health Center. However, I find the website hard to navigate, because I am bombarded with so much information at the home page. By improving the UX design, the website will  be more accesible, user-friendly, and less overwhelming.
