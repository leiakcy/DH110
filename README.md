# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
## DH110, Leia Ku Cheng Yee

### Make Exploring UC SHIP Coverage Accessible

As a student who has UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) coverage, I have explored the UC SHIP website numerous times before all my visitations to a clinic, a dentist, or a hospital. Especially during these times of crises, I want to ensure that the health plan covers my prescriptions and visitation outside of the UCLA Student Health Center. However, I find the website hard to navigate, because I am bombarded with so much information at the home page. By improving the UX design, the website will  be more accesible, user-friendly, and less overwhelming. 

### UC SHIP Website

https://www.ucop.edu/ucship/index.html

*UC SHIP's website is built for students enrolled in University of California's campuses, and it is where students get a better understanding about their health covereage, the benefits, claims, where to get a referral etc.  UC SHIP provides high-quality, affordable and convenient coverage that protects students from unexpected health care costs. UC SHIP in conjunction with the campus Student Health Center also works diligently with affiliated vendors (Anthem, Delta Dental, Academic Health Plans) to ensure that their systems are upgraded as soon as possible.*

### Initial Evaluation 
The search tools and information infrastructure of the page is rather confusing and can hinder user's efficiency. On the home page, there is a menu bar on the top of the page and a naviagtion bar on the left, and both bars present very different information. However, once you click on a menu item, you can no longer see the navigation bar, which hinders user control. There is also lack of organizations and hierarchy of content on the website, which needs to be fixed to ease usability.


| Heuristics | Rating | Evaluation |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | 
| **#1 Visuality of System Status**: The users are informed about what's going on through through feedback in a timely manner | 2 | When users land on the home page, they are immediately informed through the banner of what the system is about. However, with the small font size, and the large amount of information bombarded to users, it is unclear of what the key components are. And many hyperlinks in the home page are already in the navigation bar. Besides, there is no search button, so users can't directly look up the desired information.|
| **#2 Match between the system and the real world**: Design speak the users' language, and are easily reconignzable by users  | 2 | Most of the terminology of the items in the menu bar and navigation bar are easy to understand, except for "Plan Doc". The way I interpreted "Plan Doc" is the documents for different health plans; but it may hinder other users' understanding.|
| **#3 User control and freedom**: Users can undo or redo when mistakes were made | 1 | Users can always return to the previous page, with a simple "back" button. |
| **#4 Consistency and standards**: Design is consistent through all pages | 2 | The navigation bar is not consistent in all pages. If users click on any menu items, they will be brought to a page where the navigation bar does not exist.|
| **#5 Error prevention**: Design can prevent problems from surfacing | 3 | Having a search button that provides text input and suggestions can help users in searching the information they desire. Because of the confusing navigation and menu layout, it is possible for users to click on the wrong item. |
| **#6 Recognition rather than recall**: Information required for the design should be easily retrievable | 3 | The overall design and terminology of the website makes it difficult for users to recall the workings of the system. For instance, the home page is extremely wordy and lengthy, with lack of organization and hierarchy in content, resulting in difficulty in the comprehension of information. Moreover, since there is the top menu bar and the navigation bar, users might have trouble recalling which place they obtained information from. |
| **#7 Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Design that ease users to tailor frequent actions | 2 | Although the navigation bar acts as a good filter for different coverages, there is no search button that allow users to find specific information quickly. |
| **#8 Aesthetic and minimalistic design**: Design is easily accessible and contain relevant information | 2 | Even though the website design is decent and is filled with relevant information that is useful to users, at first glance, the pages are too wordy, lengthy and complex. Repeated information like hypertext and hyperlinks that already exist in the menu bar should be removed to make the pages appear to be more minimalistic.|
| **#9 Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Express error messages in plain language, and construct solutions for users | 1 | There were no  signicant errors found on the website, however, it'll be great for users to know if error noticications are automatically turned on. |
| **#10 Help and documentation**: Design that help users understand how to finish their task | 1 | There is FAQ, and "Get in Touch" on the menu bar, which allow users to find solutions to their problems and questions. Furthermore, the website also provides a lot of resources and documentation that guide users step by step, for instance, "three steps to getting dental care", "10 things to know about UC SHIP" etc. But one thing that the website can improve on is to include a keyword search page that help users target their issues and concerns.

### Initial Evaluation

Overall, the website is not very easily navigable. Seniors may struggle to navigate around the website because of the complex hyperlinks on the multiple side bars. The content is slightly disorganized, and lack content hierarchy that hinder users to quickly find their desired information. Instead, they have to scroll through the lengthy homepage. Besides, having a tittle on each page can also ease usability so users can identify what page they are on. In short, the website needs quite some work to improve usability.

| Heuristics | Rating | Evaluation |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | 
| **#1 Visuality of System Status**: The users are informed about what's going on through through feedback in a timely manner | 3 | Once users click on any menu items, there isn't a clear indication of what page the user is on. This can lead to inefficiency because users may not recall which menu items they have clicked on at the first place.|
| **#2 Match between the system and the real world**: Design speak the users' language, and are easily reconignzable by users  | 1 | The terminology on the website is simple and easily interpretable. There are also little to no icons used, so users can just navigate to their desired pages through reading the menu items. |
| **#3 User control and freedom**: Users can undo or redo when mistakes were made | 3 | There is no indication of what page the user is on, and there also isn't a "Home" button. This hinders user control because users may not be aware that they have to click on the logo to navigate back to the homepage. Instead, they may think the only way to navigate back is to click on "back" multiple times. |
| **#4 Consistency and standards**: Design is consistent through all pages | 2 | The design is rather consistent throughout the different webpages. However, the font style on a few webpages were not consistent.|
| **#5 Error prevention**: Design can prevent problems from surfacing | 3 | There is no clear way for users to navigate back to previous pages. The option to filter out information is also hidden at the bottom of the pages, resulting in decreased efficiency. |
| **#6 Recognition rather than recall**: Information required for the design should be easily retrievable | 3 | The overall design and terminology of the website makes it difficult for users to recall the workings of the system. For instance, the side bars of the pages are not organized, making it difficult for users to retreive information. Moreover, since there is no clear indication to which page the user is on, users cannot clearly recognize the key components of the page.|
| **#7 Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Design that ease users to tailor frequent actions | 1 | There is a search button for users to quickly and efficiently look up desired information, rather than having to browse through the complex navigation bars.|
| **#8 Aesthetic and minimalistic design**: Design is easily accessible and contain relevant information | 3 | At first glance, the website design is simple, but also boring. It is consistent throughout the pages, but the pictures used for all the headers are in low quality. The pages are also very lengthy, and bombarded with a lot hypertext that made the design look slightly disorganized. |
| **#9 Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Express error messages in plain language, and construct solutions for users | 1 | There were no  signicant errors found on the website, however, it'll be great for users to know if error noticications are automatically turned on. |
| **#10 Help and documentation**: Design that help users understand how to finish their task | 2 | Although the purpose of the site is to help seniors with problems, there are no guides to the website itself. The contact information was almost not visible, and hidden at the footer, users will have to scroll through lengthy pages just to see the information. Instead, they should have the contact information at the menu bar.
