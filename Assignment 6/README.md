## Description of Project

**Purpose**: This is a high-fidelity testing of the Suddenly Senior website. The website prototype is created by Figma. The purpose of the testing is to examine the functions of newly added features, the login and sign up pages, and the submission page. This high-fidelity prototype is transformed from the low-fidelity hand-drawn prototype with improved graphic elements, UI material components, and features.

**Process**: This high-fidelity, interactive prototype was created based on multiple steps in the designing process. First, the interactions were chosen based on observations and analysis from usability testing and contextual analysis. Then, based on the user personas I created, I find solutions to the issues that they face by including new features. Next, I did my low-fidelity prototype by handrawing wireframes and fireflow, which I also tested with two users. Their feedback is significant bwcause it allows me to make changes to my high-fidelity prototype.

## Impression Test 
The recording of the impression test is [here!](https://ucla.zoom.us/rec/share/BNOhTEbnCDlCxx3PesgXKaPHhl9-rg9w6bLYdKId57FM0FsmpKYt8yQb-Rfyg5fb.p-WTRDTSmj_MQ-LL)
Access Passcode: is.0&67j

### Summary
The user's impression of the high-fidelity wireframes were that they are simple, straightforward and minimalistic. She really enjoyed how not wordy the pages are, and how easily she can navigate across the website. However, she thinks the font sizes of the website may be too small for senior citizens to read. This feedback is very useful to be because it made me more aware of the accessibility of the website, and I will be sure to make some changes to my high-fidelity prototype. Out of the three design variations, her favorite was the one with the yellow color scheme, because it enlightens the mood, and illustrates how fun and happy the website is.

## Accessibility (color-contrast) check
The plugin that I installed on Figma is Color Contrast Checker. I was able to make some changes to the colors after identifying some errors. Examples are shown below.

## Design System
- **Typography**: For typography, I used "Mulish" for all the headings, because I think it is similar to the original font exhibited on the website and it is also  a style that is easily interpretable and very minimal.  For readability, I chose to keep using one font on the website, but with different sizes, colors and capitalizations to distinguish title and body text.The font sizes for all Heading 1 is 40pt, whereas Heading 2 is 24pt.

- **Color**:Since I created three design variations, the color scheme that I am most likely to go for is the yellow, black, and white. After doing the impression test, I have decided to choose this color scheme because it's less dull, and is more likely to grab users' attention. For a relatively simple and clean outlook, I choose to stick with three colors: 1. Yellow #FFB101; 2. Black #000000; and 3. The gray color, #F0F3F6. 

- **Layout**: The grid I used for the layout is row and columns. I realized having vertical and horizontal spatial zones is a great way to space content out evenly and efficiently.
 
Overall, I decided to make the graphic design minimal and uncluttered, providing necessary information as needed but otherwise keeping the interface clean of extraneous information. I designed the interface to be friendly, with rounded buttons, and accessible for everyone to use.

## Reflection

In this whole process of designing the high fidelity prototype, I have realized that many small details on the website needs attention, including the color contrast, accessibility, typography etc. All details make an impact to the how users interact with the website, and how efficiently they can use it. I have also learned the importance of user testing in high-fidelity prototype because small details are easily overlooked while designing. After the impression test, cognitive walkthrough, and peer review, I have made multiple changes to my prototype to ensure that the experience is improved, more user-friendly and accessible to use. In this project, I have also gained a better understanding of my choice of prototype tool "Figma" and analyzed factors that influence the design of user input and feedback in an interactive system. Overall, the process went very smoothly and I will continue toexamine the interactions by checking what I want to use for the default action of the website.
