# Assigment 06: Interface Design
## Leia Ku Cheng Yee, DH110

## Description of Project

**Purpose**: This is a high-fidelity testing of the Suddenly Senior website. The website prototype is created by Figma. The purpose of the testing is to examine the functions of newly added features, the login and sign up pages, and the submission page. This high-fidelity prototype is transformed from the low-fidelity hand-drawn prototype with improved graphic elements, UI material components, and features.

**Process**: This high-fidelity, interactive prototype was created based on multiple steps in the designing process. First, the interactions were chosen based on observations and analysis from usability testing and contextual analysis. Then, based on the user personas I created, I find solutions to the issues that they face by including new features. Next, I did my low-fidelity prototype by handrawing wireframes and fireflow, which I also tested with two users. Their feedback is significant bwcause it allows me to make changes to my high-fidelity prototype.

This prototype allows users to:
- Browse articles
- Log in to account 
- Sign up to new account
- Upload media

## Impression Test 
The recording of the impression test is [here!](https://ucla.zoom.us/rec/share/BNOhTEbnCDlCxx3PesgXKaPHhl9-rg9w6bLYdKId57FM0FsmpKYt8yQb-Rfyg5fb.p-WTRDTSmj_MQ-LL)
Access Passcode: is.0&67j

### Summary
The user's impression of the high-fidelity wireframes were that they are simple, straightforward and minimalistic. She really enjoyed how not wordy the pages are, and how easily she can navigate across the website. However, she thinks the font sizes of the website may be too small for senior citizens to read. This feedback is very useful to be because it made me more aware of the accessibility of the website, and I will be sure to make some changes to my high-fidelity prototype. Out of the three design variations, her favorite was the one with the yellow color scheme, because it enlightens the mood, and illustrates how fun and happy the website is.

## Accessibility (color-contrast) check
The plugin that I installed on Figma is Color Contrast Checker. I was able to make some changes to the colors after identifying some errors. Examples are shown below.

## Design System
- **Typography**: For typography, I used "Mulish" for all the headings, because I think it is similar to the original font exhibited on the website and it is also  a style that is easily interpretable and very minimal. The font sizes for all Heading 1 is 40pt, whereas Heading 2 is 24pt. Furthermore, as for all of the body fonts, I chose to go with "Roboto".

- **Color**:Since I created three design variations, the color scheme that I am most likely to go for is the light mode one. For a relatively simple and clean outlook, I choose to stick with three colors: 1. Blue #3C64B1; 2. Black #000000; and 3. The gray color, #F0F3F6. 

- **Layout**: The grid I used for the layout is row and columns. I realized having vertical and horizontal spatial zones is a great way to space content out evenly and efficiently.
 
Overall, I decided to make the graphic design minimal and uncluttered, providing necessary information as needed but otherwise keeping the interface clean of extraneous information. I designed the interface to be friendly, with rounded buttons, and accessible for everyone to use.
