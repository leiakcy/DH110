## Suddenly Senior
## Leia Ku Cheng Yee

### Introduction: a brief information about the project 
The main purpose of this Suddenly Senior is to provide resources, entertaintment and guide seniors in their day-to-day activities. This project can also help users to find their communities, and self-develop during their leisure time. Suddenly Senior also provides users a platform to share their files by easily uploading them. The resources that the website provide include articles, jokes and trivias. 

### Clear design statement
There are various sites that already exist that provide resources to seniors like Senior Guide to Computers, Senior Net etc. Although there are many of these websites that already exist, there are few that consolidate these resources in an easily understandable, and engaging way. The limitations that could be improved with technology are that it is hard to refine and filter information, and the disorganization of information can hinder usability. There is also lack indication of what page the users are on, making it difficult for users to recall the workings of the system.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated

The purpose of a heuristic evaluation is to thoroughly assess the productâ€™s user interface, and detect usability issues that may occur when users interact with a product, and identify ways to resolve them. I evaluated two different websites that both serves the purpose of providing content to users, one being the UC SHIP website, and the other being the Suddenly Senior website. The UC SHIP's website is built for students enrolled in University of California's campuses, and it is where students get a better understanding about their health covereage, the benefits, claims, where to get a referral etc. Similarly, Suddenly Senior is a website that provides humorous content, advocacy and useful information for seniors.

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing

The purpose of usability testing (UT) is to identify issues with the product design and improve the overall usability and satisfaction of a product. In contrast to heuristic evaluation, UT provides a more accurate inspection of how a random participant would interact with a product. It is necessary to test whether a product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory for users. The UT process can also inform potential users about the unreleased project, as well as help identify problems in the interface early, eliminating possible future spending and damage control.

### User research: Contextual Inquiry
Based off the findings of the heuristic evaluation, and pilot usability test, the research has reached its next phase of data collection. Contextual inquiry can help designers to gain insights and uncover usability problems that they didn't notice from conducting the heauristic evaluation. Through conducting contextual inquiry, I have learned to see how the user interact with the product, and it provided me a lot of useful data for improvements. When performing the interview, I learned that is important to eliminate all biases and try to view the product from an outsider perspective, and to keep my script for contextual inquiry rather loose and flexible, so the users can have their own way of interacting with the website. The ultimate goal is to identify translatable qualitative data that can be used to help improve and/or create new features pertaining to the Suddenly Senior website.

### UX storytelling 
The purpose of UX storytelling is to have a better understanding of the users by putting ourselves in their shoes, and understand their perspectives of the product. It allows design teams and developers to gain insights into the users' goals, empathize with their personalized stories, and build a solution around it.  Additionally, it allows team to filter out biases so that they may work effectively to design a cohesive product.

**Design features that I suggested are:**
1. Filters 
2. Upload page
3. The search function 
4. 'Share' feature
5. Save to draft/edit draft

**Why Larry is using this product**
> Larry is a retired teacher and he has a lot of knowledge that he wants to share with others. He wants to digitize his work, and also upload them on the website so people can have access to them. Since he has a lot of free time now, he also wants to learn from others because he thinks knowledge is limitless and wants to keep his mind active. He also wants to find a buddy to bounce around ideas with, because he thinks learning together sparks more creativity. 

**How Larry is using this product** 
> When Larry clicked on the website, he navigated to the "Upload" page, filled in his name, the tittle of the document, uploaded the PDF, and then clicked the "Publish" button, feeling satisified. At first, he didn't see the "Save as draft" option, and once he clicked "back", all his documents disappeared. After a few tries, he realized he could save the documents as drafts and also go back and make any changes by clicking on an icon for edit. As he browse around the website, he also found a "Find a study group" option, which can allow him to connect with others. He was really excited, and immediately signed up for it by putting his name, number, email address, and his demographics information.
