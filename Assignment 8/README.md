## Suddenly Senior
## Leia Ku Cheng Yee

### Introduction: a brief information about the project 
The main purpose of this Suddenly Senior is to provide resources, entertaintment and guide seniors in their day-to-day activities. This project can also help users to find their communities, and self-develop during their leisure time. Suddenly Senior also provides users a platform to share their files by easily uploading them. The resources that the website provide include articles, jokes and trivias. 

### Clear design statement
There are various sites that already exist that provide resources to seniors like Senior Guide to Computers, Senior Net etc. Although there are many of these websites that already exist, there are few that consolidate these resources in an easily understandable, and engaging way. The limitations that could be improved with technology are that it is hard to refine and filter information, and the disorganization of information can hinder usability. There is also lack indication of what page the users are on, making it difficult for users to recall the workings of the system.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

The purpose of a heuristic evaluation is to thoroughly assess the productâ€™s user interface, and detect usability issues that may occur when users interact with a product, and identify ways to resolve them. I evaluated two different websites that both serves the purpose of providing content to users, one being the UC SHIP website, and the other being the Suddenly Senior website. The UC SHIP's website is built for students enrolled in University of California's campuses, and it is where students get a better understanding about their health covereage, the benefits, claims, where to get a referral etc. Similarly, Suddenly Senior is a website that provides humorous content, advocacy and useful information for seniors.

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing

After my evaluation of the website, in order to confirm them, I conducted a usability test. The purpose of usability testing (UT) is to identify issues with the product design and improve the overall usability and satisfaction of a product. In contrast to heuristic evaluation, UT provides a more accurate inspection of how a random participant would interact with a product. It is necessary to test whether a product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory for users. The UT process can also inform potential users about the unreleased project, as well as help identify problems in the interface early, eliminating possible future spending and damage control.

### User research: Contextual Inquiry
Based off the findings of the heuristic evaluation, and pilot usability test, the research has reached its next phase of data collection. Contextual inquiry can help designers to gain insights and uncover usability problems that they didn't notice from conducting the heauristic evaluation. Through conducting contextual inquiry, I have learned to see how the user interact with the product, and it provided me a lot of useful data for improvements. When performing the interview, I learned that is important to eliminate all biases and try to view the product from an outsider perspective, and to keep my script for contextual inquiry rather loose and flexible, so the users can have their own way of interacting with the website. The ultimate goal is to identify translatable qualitative data that can be used to help improve and/or create new features pertaining to the Suddenly Senior website.

### UX storytelling 
In order to have a better understanding of the users by putting ourselves in their shoes, and understand their perspectives of the product, I created user personas, empathy maps and journey maps. It allows design teams and developers to gain insights into the users' goals, empathize with their personalized stories, and build a solution around it.  Additionally, it allows team to filter out biases so that they may work effectively to design a cohesive product.

**Why Larry is using this product**
> Larry is a retired teacher and he has a lot of knowledge that he wants to share with others. He wants to digitize his work, and also upload them on the website so people can have access to them. Since he has a lot of free time now, he also wants to learn from others because he thinks knowledge is limitless and wants to keep his mind active. He also wants to find a buddy to bounce around ideas with, because he thinks learning together sparks more creativity. 

**How Larry is using this product** 
> When Larry clicked on the website, he navigated to the "Upload" page, filled in his name, the tittle of the document, uploaded the PDF, and then clicked the "Publish" button, feeling satisified. At first, he didn't see the "Save as draft" option, and once he clicked "back", all his documents disappeared. After a few tries, he realized he could save the documents as drafts and also go back and make any changes by clicking on an icon for edit. As he browse around the website, he also found a "Find a study group" option, which can allow him to connect with others. He was really excited, and immediately signed up for it by putting his name, number, email address, and his demographics information.

### Low-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of my low-fidelity prototypes is to check and test the functionality and flow of the new features. It allows me to translate my high-level design concepts into physical and tangible entities that other people can interact with in order to identify flaws in functionality. In this project, I have just added the feature for users to upload documents, share and filter articles.

**Design features that I suggested are:**
1. Filters 
2. Upload page
3. The search function 
4. 'Share' feature
5. Save to draft/edit draft

### High-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of a high-fidelity prototype is to examine the functions of newly added features, the login and sign up pages, and the submission page. This high-fidelity prototype is transformed from the low-fidelity hand-drawn prototype with improved graphic elements, UI material components, and features. Besides, this high-fidelity, interactive prototype was created based on multiple steps in the designing process. First, the interactions were chosen based on observations and analysis from usability testing and contextual analysis. Then, based on the user personas I created, I find solutions to the issues that they face by including new features. Next, I did my low-fidelity prototype by handrawing wireframes and fireflow, which I also tested with two users. Their feedback is significant because it allows me to make changes to my high-fidelity prototype.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation

I created three design variation to see which one I like better. After doing the impression test, I decided to go with the yellow, black, and white color scheme because it's cheerful, bright, and is more likely to grab users' attention.

## Evaluation and revision history 
### Cognitive walkthrough
Cognitive walkthroughs are used to examine the usability of a product. They are designed to see whether or not a new user can easily carry out tasks within a given system.

**Summary**: The user was able to finish the tasks easily by navigating through the website with different buttons. One useful feedback that I got from the user was that to add a "back" button at every page, so users can navigate to the last page without going back to the homepage. After carefully going through the website with the user, I was also able to identify some design errors, like the font size standardization.

### Impression test
An impression test captures users' first impressions of a website based on a handful of critical components â€“ images, colors, layout, key words and phrase.

The recording of the impression test is [here!](https://ucla.zoom.us/rec/share/BNOhTEbnCDlCxx3PesgXKaPHhl9-rg9w6bLYdKId57FM0FsmpKYt8yQb-Rfyg5fb.p-WTRDTSmj_MQ-LL)
(Access Passcode: is.0&67j)

**Summary:** The user's impression of the high-fidelity wireframes were that they are simple, straightforward and minimalistic. She really enjoyed how not wordy the pages are, and how easily she can navigate across the website. However, she thinks the font sizes of the website may be too small for senior citizens to read. This feedback is very useful to be because it made me more aware of the accessibility of the website, and I will be sure to make some changes to my high-fidelity prototype. Out of the three design variations, her favorite was the one with the yellow color scheme, because it enlightens the mood, and illustrates how fun and happy the website is.

### Conclusion
I have learned a few things in the process of redesigning the Suddenly Senior Website:
1. **Importance of test and research:** In this process, I have learned about how to evaluate sites and prototypes through different methods, like heuristic evaluation, contextual inquiry, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability tests etc. I have learned to understand the significance of gathering quantitative and qualitative data to gain more insight about the design, and about the user. 
2. **Graphical Interface Accessibility:** In this process, I have learned about the importance of accessibility, especially about color contrast, and the use of plugins on Figma to test that. 

Overall, I think this project is very rewarding and I have definitely gained a lot of knowledge and experience with the field. In the future, I would do more usability tests and field research to see how different users react to my prototype. Because there are so many different types of users, I want to see if my site addresses the majority's needs.
